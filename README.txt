**IMPORTANT**
Keep the .csv files in the same folder location as the lookup.py program. I'm using relative file paths and not having these files in the same location will result in the program not finding a .csv anymore.


## Installation

--You will need to install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage

--Open the lookup.py file with python and follow the on screen prompts

--Minimum number of pips will filter any reagents that do not have at least a single property that matches your input
	--EX If you input a 5 for the property "Mana".
	  	-Name: Mandrake Root
		-Properties: {'Mind': '', 'Create': '', 'Energy': '5', 'Water': ''}

## Usage

Please feel free to report any bugs, inconsistencies, or other problems to me via discord and I will attempt to fix them! Thank you!
